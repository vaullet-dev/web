#
# The one place that answers "what version is this build?".
# ============================================================================
#
# There is no version number committed anywhere in this repository, and `main` never
# carries a -SNAPSHOT. Both are the same decision: a version is a statement about what
# changed, and the only record of what changed is the commit log. Deriving the number
# from the log means it cannot disagree with the code, and there is no "bump the
# version" commit to forget, to conflict, or to get wrong.
#
# Three commit types, three levels. Nothing else moves the number:
#
#   breaking  -> MAJOR   a consumer must change something to keep working
#   feature   -> MINOR   something new, everything that worked still works
#   patch     -> PATCH   a fix, with no visible API change
#
# Written as Conventional Commits (https://conventionalcommits.org), with the three
# words above accepted as aliases for the standard spellings, so both read naturally:
#
#   feat: add partial release to reservations        -> MINOR
#   feature(api): add partial release                -> MINOR   (alias of feat)
#   fix: reject a hold whose currency does not match -> PATCH
#   patch: reject a mismatched currency              -> PATCH   (alias of fix)
#   feat!: money is a string, never a JSON number    -> MAJOR   ('!' marks breaking)
#   breaking: drop the v1 reservation endpoint       -> MAJOR   (alias of '!')
#
#   refactor: extract the allocation loop            -> PATCH
#   chore/docs/test/ci/style: ...                    -> no release
#   deploy: web 1.2.0                                -> no release  (the bot's deploy PR)
#
# A `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in the body also forces MAJOR, which is how you describe
# a break that the subject line has no room for.
#
# `ci lint` rejects a commit whose subject matches none of these, so an unrecognised
# message fails a pull request instead of silently contributing nothing to the number.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What comes out
#
#   on main/master   X.Y.Z                     a release; this is what gets tagged
#   anywhere else    X.Y.Z-<branch>-<n>        a pre-release of the version main is
#                                              heading for, never published as a release
#
# The branch form uses the NEXT version, not the last released one. `0.2.0-holds-7`
# sorts after 0.1.0 and before 0.2.0 under both semver and Maven's own ordering, which
# is exactly what a branch build is: after the last release, ahead of the next one.
# Using the last released version instead would produce `0.1.0-holds-7`, which sorts
# BEFORE the 0.1.0 it was branched from — a build that claims to be older than its own
# parent. To change that anyway, drop the `min_bump patch` call in cmd_version.
#
# A branch with only chore/docs commits still needs a number, so it is floored at a
# patch bump; a release with only chore/docs commits is correctly no release at all.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Usage
#
#   scripts/version.sh              the version this build should carry
#   scripts/version.sh bump         major | minor | patch | none
#   scripts/version.sh tag          the git tag for a release build (vX.Y.Z)
#   scripts/version.sh lint [range] fail on a commit that does not follow the convention
#   scripts/version.sh lint-subject "feat: ..."   the same check on one subject line
#   scripts/version.sh explain      all of the above, for a CI log or a puzzled human
#
# The same script as backend-common and wallet-ledger-service, so a commit message means the same
# thing in every repository. Here the version becomes the image tag, ghcr.io/vaullet-dev/web:X.Y.Z,
# and the tag that kustomization.yaml deploys.
#
# Environment overrides, all optional:
#   VERSION_BRANCH   branch name, when git cannot tell (CI checks out a detached HEAD)
#   BUILD_NUMBER     the incrementing part of a branch version; CI passes its run number

The commit subjects above do not follow the convention, so the release level cannot
be read from them. Expected  <type>[(scope)][!]: <description>  where <type> is one of:

  breaking          a consumer must change something         -> MAJOR
  feat | feature    something new, nothing broken            -> MINOR
  fix | patch       a fix, no visible API change             -> PATCH
  perf refactor revert build deps security                   -> PATCH
  chore docs test ci style deploy                            -> no release

Add `!` after the type, or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer, to force MAJOR.
Fix with `git rebase -i` (or reword the pull request's squash subject).
